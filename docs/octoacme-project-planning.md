# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Roles & Personas

Successful project planning requires clear understanding of who does what. Refer to the [OctoAcme Roles & Personas](./octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) document for detailed role definitions, responsibilities, and interaction patterns.

### Key Roles in Planning
- **Product Owner:** Prioritizes backlog based on business value; defines vision and acceptance criteria
- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates planning activities, manages timeline and resources, facilitates meetings
- **Engineering Lead:** Provides technical feasibility input, estimates complexity, identifies technical dependencies
- **QA Lead:** Reviews acceptance criteria for testability, drafts initial test approach
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates sprint planning, ensures team capacity is respected
- **Project Sponsor:** Approves project charter, provides strategic direction, removes executive-level obstacles

### How to Engage Personas During Planning
1. **Kickoff Meeting:** PM facilitates; invite Product Owner, Engineering Lead, QA Lead, key stakeholders
2. **Backlog Prioritization:** Product Owner leads with PM support; consult Engineering Lead on feasibility, QA Lead on testability
3. **Estimation Sessions:** Engineering team estimates with guidance from Engineering Lead; Scrum Master facilitates
4. **Risk Identification:** PM leads; all roles contribute risks from their domain (technical, quality, change management)
5. **Timeline & Milestones:** PM proposes; Product Owner and Project Sponsor approve based on business priorities
6. **Dependencies:** Engineering Lead identifies technical dependencies; PM coordinates cross-team handoffs with other PMs

### RACI for Planning Activities
- **Kickoff Meeting:** PM (R/A), Product Owner (R), Engineering Lead (C), QA Lead (C)
- **Backlog Prioritization:** Product Owner (A/R), PM (C), Engineering Lead (C), QA Lead (C)
- **Estimation:** Engineering Lead (A), Developers (R), PM (I)
- **Release Plan:** PM (A/R), Product Owner (C), Engineering Lead (C), Project Sponsor (I)

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs

## Planning Checklist
