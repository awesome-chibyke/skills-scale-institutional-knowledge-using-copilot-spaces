## Roles & Personas (new)
Purpose: Guide PMs on which personas to engage during planning and what to confirm with each.

Key steps for PM during planning
- Identify which personas are needed for this project (Product Owner, Sponsor, QA Lead, Change Manager, Communication Coordinator).
- Schedule a planning alignment meeting including Product Owner, Engineering Lead, and Scrum Master to finalize backlog priorities and acceptance criteria.
- Confirm QA Lead availability and test environment readiness.
- Ask the Product Owner to define acceptance criteria for top backlog items before sprint planning.
- Log RACI decisions in the project plan (copy examples from roles document).
